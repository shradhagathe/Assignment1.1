Problem Statement
1. Please mention true or false for the below statements:
a) Prescriptive Analytics is used to predict the future outcomes - True
b) Base R packages are installed automatically - False
2. What is Recycling of elements in a vector?
   to apply an operation on two vectors, those vectors should be of same length. if they are different in length then R recycles or repeats the elements automatically of the shorter one until it is long enough to match the longer vector. 
3. Give an example of recycling of elements.
Suppose we have two Vectors c(1,2,4) , c(6,0,9,10,13), where the first one is shorter with only 3 elements. Now if we sum these two, we will get a warning message as follows.
> c(1,2,4) + c(6,0,9,10,13)

Warning message:
In c(1, 2, 4) + c(6, 0, 9, 10, 13) :  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
//Here R , Sum those Vectors by Recycling or repeating the elements in shorter one, until it is long enough to match the longer one as follows..//
> c(1,2,4,1,2) + c(6,0,9,10,13)
